    <p>The purpose of this site is to serve as a collective resource for Cahills around the world, young and old. Since the original demise of the franchise, <strong>39 Clues</strong> media has been scattered to the four corners of the internet. Many photographs and promotional materials have already been lost, and some are at risk of becoming lost media.</p>
